# Introduction

Welcome to the **AceTrack Documentation**.

**AceTrack** is a next-generation tennis scoreboard application designed for the Team Phoenix Tennis Scoreboard Hackathon.

## The Challenge

The objective was to build a modern, responsive, and dynamic tennis scoreboard that provides real-time match tracking, player statistics, and an immersive user experience.

## Key Goals

- **Real-time Scoring**: Track live matches with set-by-set updates.
- **Player Rankings**: A dynamic, sortable table of world-class tennis players.
- **Immersive UI**: Smooth animations, dark mode, and a premium "TV broadcast" feel.
- **Comprehensive Data**: Detailed match statistics and player comparisons.
